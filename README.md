## Abstract

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental
contaminants, with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) among the most frequently detected
in biomonitoring studies. Building on previous work quantifying PFAS in
liver and plasma of exposed mice, we expanded measurements to include
fecal and kidney concentrations and integrated these data for
toxicokinetic modeling using the High-Throughput Toxicokinetics (httk)
package v2.7.2. PFAS-specific 1-compartment models accurately predicted
plasma concentrations of PFOA and PFOS, whereas non-optimized
physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models underpredicted plasma,
liver, and kidney concentrations by ~6- to 25-fold. Despite identical
administered doses, PFOA exhibited lower concentrations than PFOS across
all matrices, consistent with faster elimination, likely via urinary
excretion. Generalized read-across analysis revealed subclass-specific
similarity patterns: PFOA aligned with other long-chain
perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), and PFOS aligned with long-chain
perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) and fluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSAs),
whereas short-chain PFAS, fluorotelomers (FTs), and GenX showed limited
structural similarity. These findings demonstrate that PFAS-optimized
1-compartment modeling provides robust plasma predictions and that
strategic subclass-based chemical read-across can streamline risk
assessment for structurally related PFAS.
